To register an account with the Web Teaching Environment you can either:

* navigate to the landing page and then click on the blue :text_link:`Register`
  link;
* click on the :topbar_link:`Register` link in the top-right corner of any
  other page.

In both cases you will be taken to the registration page where your need to
provide:

E-Mail Address
  This must be a valid e-mail address as a confirmation e-mail will be sent to
  this address and you cannot log in until you have followed the link in the
  confirmation e-mail.

Your Name
  Your name that will be used to identify you in the Web Teaching Environment.

Then click on the :primary_btn:`Register` button to start the actual
registration process. If you have not previously registered with the same
e-mail address then a confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address
you entered.

The confirmation e-mail includes a link that will verify your registration.
Either click on the link in your e-mail program or copy the link into your
browser. If you do not receive an e-mail, please check your spam folder.

After using the link to verify your registration, you will be sent a second
e-mail that includes a password with which you can :doc:`login <login>` to the
system. After logging in the first time, it is recommended that you change your
password in your :doc:`profile`.
