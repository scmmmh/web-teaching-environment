corner (the ``Your Name`` text will be replaced with the actual name you

Editing Your Profile
====================

To edit your profile, either move your mouse over the :topbar_link:`Your Name`
area in the top-right corner and then select the
:topbar_link:`Edit your Profile` option from the menu that appears or on the
profile page itself, click on the :primary_btn:`Edit your profile` button.

On the profile editing page you can change the following three aspects of your
profile:

E-Mail Address
  This will show the e-mail address that is currently being used for your
  account. If you change this, please make sure that the e-mail address is
  valid as a confirmation e-mail will be sent to that address. Also this is the
  e-mail address that will be used to handle :doc:`forgotten_password`.

Your Name
  This is the name that is shown on the Web Teaching Environment to identify
  you to your tutors. 

New Password
  By entering a new password into this field, you can change the password you
  use for logging into the Web Teaching Environment.
  
  Leave this field blank if you do not want to change your password.

After you have made the changes you want to your profile, click on the
:primary_btn:`Update` button to save your changes. Your changes will be saved
and you will be taken back to your profile page. If you do not want to save
any changes, click on the :secondary_btn:`Don't Update` button.

Deleting Your Account
=====================

From the profile page you can also delete your account. To do this, click on
the :alert_btn:`Delete your account` button. You will be asked to confirm that
you wish to delete your account. To confirm, click on the :alert_btn:`Delete`
button. Your account will be deleted immediately and you will be logged out.

.. warning:: Deleting your account will also delete any work you have done in
   the Web Teaching Environment, any files you have uploaded, and any projects you
   have created. These **cannot** be retrieved after you delete your account.
