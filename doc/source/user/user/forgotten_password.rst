Forgotten Password
******************

If you have forgotten your password and cannot log in, then on the :doc:`login <login>`
page, click on the :secondary_btn:`Forgotten password` button. To request a new
password, enter the e-mail address you registered with in the ``E-Mail Address``
field and click on the :primary_btn:`Request Password` button. A new password
will be generated and e-mailed to the e-mail address you specified.

.. note:: After clicking on the :primary_btn:`Request Password` button, you
   will receive a message stating that "A new password has been sent to the
   specified e-mail address." This message will be shown regardless of whether
   an account with that e-mail address exists or not.
   
   If you do not receive an e-mail with your password within a few minutes,
   check your spam folder. If you do not receive an e-mail at all, then check
   that the e-mail address you entered is the e-mail address that you
   registered with.
