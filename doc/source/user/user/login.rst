To log in to the Web Teaching Environment you can either:

* navigate to the landing page and then click on the :text_link:`Log-in` link;
* click on the :topbar_link:`Log in` link in the top-right corner of any other page.

In both cases you will be taken to the login page, where you need to enter the
following fields:

E-Mail address 
  The e-mail address you registered with.

Password
  The password that you set or if you requested a new password, then the newly
  generated password.

Then click on the :primary_btn:`Login` button. If you have provided a valid
e-mail address and password, you will be logged in and then taken back to the
page you were on when you clicked on the :text_link:`Log-in` link. If your
e-mail address or password are incorrect, you will be shown an error message.

If you have forgotten your password, click on the
:secondary_btn:`Forgotten Password` button and use the :doc:`forgotten_password`
functionality to retrieve a new password.
