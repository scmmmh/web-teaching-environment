Text Sections
-------------

Text sections are the basic structure for showing a module's content.
To navigate between the pages of a section, there are :text_link:`Previous page`
and :text_link:`Next page` links that at the top and bottom of each page. Additionally
you can use the drop-down list to quickly jump between pages.
