Text Sections
-------------

Text sections are the basic structure for showing a module's content.
To navigate between the pages of a section, there are :text_link:`Previous page`
and :text_link:`Next page` links that at the top and bottom of each page. Additionally
you can use the drop-down list to quickly jump between pages.

Quizzes

The Web Teaching Environment allows the tutor to set small quizzes. To answer the quiz,
simply select the correct answers and then click on the :primary_btn:`Check Answers` button.
You will immediately be shown which answers you got right and which are wrong. You can re-try
any questions that you did not get right.
