Editing a Page
--------------

To edit a page, go to the page, move your mouse over the :icon:`fi-list` icon, and then select the
:dropdown_link:`Edit<fi-pencil>` item. The part editor consists of three parts. The centre column allows you to edit the
page's attributes and its summary (:doc:`see here for details <../editor/index>`):

**Title**
  The title of the new page. This is what will be shown in the list of pages on the part's overview page.

**Status**
  The status of the page. You can always :doc:`change this later<../status>`.

**Label**
  The label allows you to assign an arbitrary classification to each page. The label will be used in the module's list of
  parts to create the title for that list.

**Content**
  The part summary that is shown to the learner on the parts's page. For full detail on the functionality available in th
  editor :doc:`see here <../editor/index>`.

To save your changes click on the :primary_btn:`Update` button. To discard any changes, click on the :secondary_btn:`Don't Update` button.
