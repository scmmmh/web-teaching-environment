Download Content
================

You can download any module, part, or page for viewing offline. To do so, move your mouse over
the :icon:`fi-list` icon and select the :dropdown_link:`Download` item. This will generate a
ZIP file for you to download, which contains the module, part, or page you selected to download
with all its content (including any contained parts or pages).
