Delete a Module
---------------

To delete a module, hover your mouse over the :icon:`fi-list` icon and then select the
:dropdown_link:`Delete<fi-trash>` menu item. As deleting the module cannot be
undone, you are then asked to confirm that you want to delete the module.

.. warning::

  Deleting a module will also delete all its parts, pages, any assets, templates, and any learner work. This action cannot be undone.
