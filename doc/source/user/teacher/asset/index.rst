Assets
======

Assets provide the ability to upload files that can then be integrated into the teaching
materials. Two types of assets are distinguished:

* **Assets** - These include any kind of file. When included in a module's, part's, or page's content
  then image files are shown as images, while for any other file a download link is provided.
* **Templates** - Templates are only applicable to :doc:`parts<../part/index>` where the *display mode*
  has been set to "Text, Editor, & HTML Viewer". For those parts, the templates are those
  assets which the learner can edit as part of the tutorial.
