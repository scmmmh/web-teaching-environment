Deleting an Asset
-----------------

To delete an asset go to the module, part, or page that you added the asset to. At the bottom
of the page there will be a list of all assets for that module, part, or page. Move your
mouse over the :icon:`fi-list` icon and select the :dropdown_link:`Delete<fi-trash>` item.

As this action cannot be undone you will be asked to confirm that you wish to delete the asset.
