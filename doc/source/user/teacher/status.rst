Changing the Status
===================

A module or part's status define which users can access that module, part, or page's content. In
the WTE the following three status are available:

**Available**
  The module, part, or page is available and can be accessed by any user who is registered for the
  module itself or the module the part/page belongs to. A module that is **available** will also
  be listed on the :doc:`list of available modules<../learner/modules>`. A part that is
  available will be listed on the :doc:`module's page<module/index>`. A page that is available
  will be in the page navigation.

**Unavailable**
  The module, part, or page is not available. Only the module's owner and any users that have the
  "tutor" role see and can access the module or part. For all other users an unavailable
  module will not be listed on the :doc:`list of available modules<../learner/modules>`,
  an unavailable part will not be listed on the :doc:`module's page<module/index>`,
  and an unavailable page will not be part of the page navigation.

**Archived**
  The module has been archived and is not open for further registration. All users who have
  registered for the module continue to have full access, but no new users can register for
  it.

To change the status of a module or part, move your mouse over the :icon:`fi-list` icon for
the module or part and then:

* click on the :dropdown_link:`Make available<fi-unlock>` item to change the status to **available**
* click on the :dropdown_link:`Make unavailable<fi-lock>` item to change the status to **unavailable**
* click on the :dropdown_link:`Archive` item to change the status to **archived** (only for modules)
