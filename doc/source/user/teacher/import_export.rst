Importing and Exporting Content
===============================

The Web Teaching Environment allows you to export and import modules, parts, and pages. You can
use this functionality to create backups of your teaching content, but also to copy content
from one module / part to another.

When you export a module the exporter will ensure that any cross-references that refer from one
part or page to another part or page in the same module, will be maintained correctly when re-importing
(for parts this only applies to cross-references between pages of the part). Any cross-references
to other modules, parts, or pages will be replaces with an "external cross-reference" marker.

Export
------

To export a module, part, or page move your mouse over the :icon:`fi-list` icon, and then select
the :dropdown_link:`Download` item. This will generate a ZIP file that you can store locally and
that can later be imported again.

Import
------

How to import a module, part, or page depends on what you are trying to import:

* To import a :doc:`module<module/index>`, go to the list of modules, move your mouse over the :icon:`fi-list` icon, and
  select the :dropdown_link:`Import Module` item.
* To import a :doc:`part<part/index>`, go to the module that you wish to import the part into, move
  your mouse over the :icon:`fi-list` icon, and select the :dropdown_link:`Import` item.
* To import a :doc:`page<page/index>`, go to the part that you wish to import the page into, move
  your mouse over the :icon:`fi-list` icon, and select the :dropdown_link:`Import` item.

This opens the import page. Use the "Browse" button to select the ZIP file to import and then click
on the :primary_btn:`Import` button to start the import. Click on the :secondary_btn:`Don't Import`
button to cancel importing content.
