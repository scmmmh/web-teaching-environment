Installation
************

Core System
===========

To install the Web Teaching Environment, download the latest version from
https://bitbucket.org/mhall/web-teaching-environment and install using the
following command::

  pip install WebTeachingEnvironment-x.y.z.tar.gz

It is recommended that you install the Web Teaching Environment into a
`virtual environment`_.

To enable the Web Teaching Environment to work, you must then install either
`pycryptopp`_ or `PyCrypto`_ packages to enable the use of session cookies. To
install `pycryptopp`_ run::

  pip install pycryptopp

To install `PyCrypto`_, download it from https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/
and then install using the following command::

  pip install pycrypto-X.Y.tar.gz

Database Access
===============

You will also need to install database access libraries for the database you
intend to use. The Web Teaching Environment has been tested with `PostgreSQL`_
and `MySQL`_. `SQLite`_ is not supported, as it does not provide the features
required to migrate the database when the Web Teaching Environment is upgraded.
`Other database systems`_ that are supported by `SQLAlchemy`_ can be used, but
have not been tested.

To use PostgreSQL as the database, run::
  
  pip install psycopg2

For MySQL run::

  pip install mysql-python

After the installation has completed, move on to the :doc:`setup`.
