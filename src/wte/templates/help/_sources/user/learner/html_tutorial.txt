HTML Tutorial
-------------

The HTML tutorial interface consists of three parts:

* the *tutorial* content itself;
* the file *workspace*;
* and the page *viewer*.

These are laid out like this:

+----------+-----------+
| Tutorial | Workspace |
|          +-----------+
|          | Viewer    |
+----------+-----------+

Tutorial
^^^^^^^^

On the left the *tutorial* contains the actual text of the tutorial that you
are following. At the bottom of the *tutorial* you will find the
:text_link:`Previous page` and :text_link:`Next page` links that allow you to
move forwards and back through the tutorial's content.

Workspace
^^^^^^^^^

Each tutorial will consist of one or more files that you will work on as you
follow the tutorial. These files will be shown in the *workspace* area as a series
of tabs. You can switch between the files by clicking on the tab with the
filename of the file you wish to edit.

Whenever you make a change to one of the files, the change is automatically
saved to the Web Teaching Environment. If you leave the tutorial and come back
to it at a later point, the content of the files will be exactly as you left
it.

Downloading files
"""""""""""""""""

If you want to download the files' content for working on them offline, you
can do that by clicking on the menu icon in the top-right corner. This will
show you a drop-down menu, from which you select the "Download the Workspace"
option. This will generate a ZIP file, which contains all the files in the
*workspace*.

Alternatively, if you want to download a single file, click on the menu icon
on the tab of the file that you want to download. Then, from the drop-down menu
select the "Download" option to download that one file.

Discarding changes
""""""""""""""""""

Sometimes you might want to discard some or all of the changes that you have
made to one or more files and re-start with the initial file contents. To
discard all changes, click on the menu icon in the top-right corner and from
the drop-down menu select "Discard all Changes". This action cannot be undone,
so you will be asked to confirm that you want to discard all changes. If you
confirm that you want to discard all changes, the page will re-load and the
files will have been reset to their initial state.

If you want to discard the changes from a single file, click on the menu icon
in the tab of the file that you want to reset. Then select the "Discard
Changes" option from the drop-down menu. The action cannot be undone, so you
will be asked to confirm that you want to discard the changes to that file. If
you confirm that you want to discard the changes, then the page will re-load
and the file will have been reset to its initial state. All other files will
retain the modifications you have made. 

Viewer
^^^^^^

On the right-hand side in the bottom half is the page *viewer*, which shows the
HTML page's content. You can interact with this as you would with any other
HTML page and it allows you to try out what your HTML code would look like in
practice. The content of the *viewer* will automatically re-load whenever you
make a change to any of the files in the *workspace*.

View in new tab / window
""""""""""""""""""""""""

While the *viewer* works like a normal web-page, it is somewhat restricted in
its size. If you want to see what your HTML would look like in its own tab or
window, then click on the menu icon in the top-right corner of the *viewer*.
From the drop-down menu, select the "Open in new Tab/Window" option and the
page will be opened in a new tab or window (which one depends on your browser's
settings).

.. note:: The content of the new tab or window will **not** be updated
   automatically if you make any changes in the *workspace*. If you make
   changes in the *workspace* then you need to manually re-load the page in
   the new tab or window for those changes to become visible.
