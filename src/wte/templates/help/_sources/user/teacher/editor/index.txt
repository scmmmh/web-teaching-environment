Editor
======

The editor consists of three parts. In the centre is the main text editor itself. The left
consists of a toolbox that provides support for the editor (:doc:`asset` & :doc:`crossref`).
On the right-hand side is a live preview of the editor content as it will appear to the learner.

The text editor uses ReStructured Text as its basic format (:doc:`rst-primer`), augmented with funcationality for
formatting :doc:`sourcecode<sourcecode>`, :doc:`assets<asset>` (see also :doc:`../asset/index`),
:doc:`cross-references<crossref>`, and :doc:`videos<video>`.
