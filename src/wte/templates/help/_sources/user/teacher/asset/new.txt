Creating a new Asset
--------------------

To create a new asset, move your mouse over the :icon:`fi-list` icon and then
select the :dropdown_link:`Add Asset` item.

You can then either select the file to upload as the new asset by clicking on
the "Browse" button or by dragging a file into the browser window from your computer.

If you use the "Browse" button, then you can overwrite the filename that is used
in the WTE for the asset by entering it into the "Filename" field. To create the new
asset click on the :primary_btn:`Add` button.

If you dragged a file into the browser window, then this will be uploaded immediately
and the new asset created without any further interaction.
