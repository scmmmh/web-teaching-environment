Editing an Asset
----------------

To edit an asset go to the module, part, or page that you added the asset to. At the bottom
of the page there will be a list of all assets for that module, part, or page. Move your
mouse over the :icon:`fi-list` icon and select the :dropdown_link:`Edit<fi-pencil>` item.

You can edit the following attributes:

* **Filename** - the filename that is used to refer to the asset from the module, part, or page's content
* **Type** - the type of data contained in the asset
* **File** - use the "Browse" button if you want to update the asset's content

To save your changes click on the :primary_btn:`Update` button. To discard any changes, click
on the :secondary_btn:`Don't Update` button.
