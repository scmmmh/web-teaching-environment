Timed Actions
-------------

Timed actions allow you to specify that a specific change is made to your content
at a specific time. How frequently the system checks for timed actions to be run
depends on how the administrator configured the system. You should in general not
expect accuracy below 1 minute.

Timed actions are only available for modules and parts.

Add a new timed action
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add a new timed action, select the action you wish to add and click on the
:primary_btn:`Add Action` button. Currently only the following timed action is available:

* **Change Status** - This action allows you to automatically change the :doc:`status<status>`
  of the module or part at a given time.

After clicking on the :primary_btn:`Add Action` button, you will automatically be taken
to the editing page for your new timed action.

Edit a timed action
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To edit a timed action, move your mouse over the :icon:`fi-list` icon of the timed action and
click on the :dropdown_link:`Edit<fi-pencil>` item.

On the edit page you can specify the date and time that the action is to be run at and any
parameters to use when running the action. If you select a date and time that is in the past,
then the action will essentially be run immediately.

Change Status
+++++++++++++

For the *Change Status* action there is only on parameter and that is the :doc:`status<status>`
that you wish to set for the module or part at the given date and time. 

Delete a timed action
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To delete a timed action, move your mouse over the :icon:`fi-list` icon of the timed action and
click on the :dropdown_link:`Delete<fi-trash>` item. As this action cannot be undone you will
be asked to confirm it.
