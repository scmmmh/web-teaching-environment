Creating a new Page
-------------------

To create a new page, go to the :doc:`part <../part/index>` you wish to add the page to, move your mouse over the
:icon:`fi-list` icon and select the :dropdown_link:`Add Page<fi-plus>` item from the dropdown menu. Alternatively,
you can create a new page by going to another page and then selecting the :dropdown_link:`Add Page Before`
or :dropdown_link:`Add Page After` links to add a page before or after the current page.  When creating a new page,
you must provide the following two settings:

**Title**
  The title of the new page. This is what will be shown in the list of pages on the part's overview page.

**Label**
  The label allows you to assign an arbitrary classification to each page. The label will be used in the module's list of
  parts to create the title for that list.

Click on the :primary_btn:`Create` button to create the new page. You will then be taken to the :doc:`page editing interface <edit>`.
