Editing a Module
----------------

To edit a module's settings and summary, move your mouse over the module's :icon:`list`
icon and then select the :dropdown_link:`Edit<fi-pencil>` item. The module editor consists
of three parts. The centre column allows you to edit the module's attributes and its summary: 

**Title**
  The title of the new module. This is what will be shown in the list of modules.

**Status**
  Whether the module is accessible to learners or not. You can always change this at a later point (see :doc:`../status`).

**Content**
  The module summary that is shown to the learner on the module's page. For full detail on the functionality available in the editor :doc:`see here <../editor/index>`.

Additionally below the summary editor you can see a list of all the :doc:`parts <../part/index>` that the module consists of. You can re-arrange their order by dragging them.

To save your changes click on the :primary_btn:`Update` button. To discard any changes, click on the :secondary_btn:`Don't Update` button.
