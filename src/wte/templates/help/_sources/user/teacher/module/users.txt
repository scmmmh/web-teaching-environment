User Management
---------------

As the module's owner you can manage the users that are taking your module.
For each user their name, e-mail address, and role within the module are
shown to you. The role defines what they can see and do within the module:

**Owner**
  Any user with the *owner* role can access all content (regardless of
  :doc:`status <../status>`), :doc:`edit all content <edit>`,
  :doc:`delete the module <delete>`, :doc:`set the access settings <access_settings>`,
  and edit the module's users.

**Tutor**
  Users with the *tutor* role can access all content (regardless of
  :doc:`status <../status>`). However, they cannot change any of the content,
  access settings, or users.

**Student**
  Users with the *student* role can only access content that is available
  (see :doc:`../status`).  

Searching & filtering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default all users who are registered on the module are displayed. To search
for a specific user who , type all or part of their name or e-mail address into
the text box that contains the text "Search by name of e-mail" and then click
on the :primary_btn:`Search` button.

Alternatively you can also filter the list of users by their type. To do so,
select the filter criterion from the drop-down list in the top-right corner.
Then click on the :primary_btn:`Filter` button. In addition to filtering by
role, you can also show those users that have been blocked ("Blocked Users")
and those that are not blocked ("Active users").

You can also combine filtering and searching, either by searching and then filtering
or by filtering and then searching.

To see all users again remove any search terms and set the filter to "All users".
Then click on either the :primary_btn:`Search` or :primary_btn:`Filter` buttons.

Adding users
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can manually add users by clicking on the :primary_btn:`Add one or more users`
button in the bottom left-corner.

This will take you to a new page, where you can search by name or e-mail address
for the user you wish to add. If the user is already registered for the module,
then they will not appear in the list of search results.

To add a user, select the checkbox to the left of the name of the user you wish to
add. You can select multiple users and then all of them will be added. Next, select
the role that you wish to give the user. finally click on the :primary_btn:`Add`
button to actually add the users to the module.

Removing users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To remove a user, select the checkbox next to their name and then in the bottom-right
corner select "Remove" as the action to apply to the user. Then click on the
:primary_btn:`Apply` button. You can remove multiple users at the same time by
selecting multiple users' checkboxes.

The action will de-register the users and delete all their work that is linked to
the module. You will thus be asked to confirm that you wish to remove the users.

.. note::

  A removed user can register for the module again, if they pass the
  :doc:`access_settings`. To permanently block access use the `Blocking users`_.
  
Blocking users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to stop a user accessing the module, then you need to block them (as
users who are just removed can re-register). To do so, select the checkbox next 
to their name and then in the bottom-right corner select "block" as the action
to apply to the user. Then click on the :primary_btn:`Apply` button. You can block
multiple users at the same time by selecting multiple users' checkboxes.

This action will not affect any of the users' work linked to the module, you can
thus always unblock them by changing their role back "Student".

Changing a user's role
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To change a user's role, select the checkbox next to the name of the user you wish
to modify. Then select "Change Role" as the action to apply to the user. Then click
on the :primary_btn:`Apply` button. You can change multiple users' status by
selecting multiple users' checkboxes.

After clicking on :primary_btn:`Apply`, you are shown the list of users that will
have their status changed. Then select the new role for those users and click on
:primary_btn:`Apply Changes` to actually change the users' roles.
