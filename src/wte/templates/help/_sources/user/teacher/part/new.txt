Creating a new Part
-------------------

To create a new part, go to the :doc:`module <../module/index>` you wish to add the part to, move your mouse over the
:icon:`fi-list` icon and select the :dropdown_link:`Add Part<fi-plus>` item from the dropdown menu. When creating a new
part, you must provide the following four settings:

**Title**
  The title of the new part. This is what will be shown in the list of parts displayed for the module.

**Status**
  The initial status of the new part. You can always :doc:`change this later<../status>`.

**Label**
  The label allows you to assign an arbitrary classification to each part. The label will be used in the module's list of
  parts to create the title for that list, to allow the learner to filter different types of parts, and to label which
  part takes which role.
  
**Page Display Mode**
  This setting defines how each of the pages in the part will be displayed. Currently the WTE supports two different display
  modes:
  
  * **text only** - The default setting simply shows the learner the text on each page.
  * **Text, Editor, & HTML Viewer** - With this setting each page consists of the page's text on the left, and the
    right-hand side is split into a tabbed editor and a HTML viewer. This is useful when teaching HTML-related content
    as it allows the learner to edit the HTML / CSS / JavaScript in the same window as where they have the tutorial
    and they can instantly see what their work looks like in the viewer.

Click on the :primary_btn:`Create` button to create the new part. You will then be taken to the :doc:`part editing interface <edit>`.
