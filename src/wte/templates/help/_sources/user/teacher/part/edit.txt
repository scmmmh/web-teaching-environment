Editing a Part
--------------

To edit a part, go to the part's overview page, then move your mouse over the :icon:`fi-list` icon, and then select the
:dropdown_link:`Edit<fi-pencil>` item. The part editor consists of three parts. The centre column allows you to edit the
part's attributes and its summary (:doc:`see here for details <../editor/index>`):

**Title**
  The title of the part. This is what will be shown in the list of parts displayed for the module.

**Status**
  The status of the part. You can always :doc:`change this later<../status>`.

**Label**
  The label allows you to assign an arbitrary classification to each part. The label will be used in the module's list of
  parts to create the title for that list, to allow the learner to filter different types of parts, and to label which
  part takes which role.
  
**Page Display Mode**
  This setting defines how each of the pages in the part will be displayed. Currently the WTE supports two different display
  modes:
  
  * **text only** - The default setting simply shows the learner the text on each page.
  * **Text, Editor, & HTML Viewer** - With this setting each page consists of the page's text on the left, and the
    right-hand side is split into a tabbed editor and a HTML viewer. This is useful when teaching HTML-related content
    as it allows the learner to edit the HTML / CSS / JavaScript in the same window as where they have the tutorial
    and they can instantly see what their work looks like in the viewer.

**Content**
  The part summary that is shown to the learner on the parts's page. For full detail on the functionality available in th
  editor :doc:`see here <../editor/index>`.

Additionally below the summary editor you can see a list of all the :doc:`pages <../part/index>` that the part contains.
You can re-arrange their order by dragging them.

To save your changes click on the :primary_btn:`Update` button. To discard any changes, click on the :secondary_btn:`Don't Update` button.
