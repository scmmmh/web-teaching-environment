Creating Teaching Materials
***************************

The Web Teaching Environment combines a relatively strict basic structure for teaching materials
with a large amount of flexibility within the materials. The main element for structuring content
is the :doc:`module <module/index>`. Each module consists of :doc:`parts <part/index>` and the actual content
of each part is spread across a number of :doc:`pages <page/index>`. This core structure is rigid and it is this
rigidity that enables the Web Teaching Environment to provide a highly usable and easily understandable
interface to the learners.

At the same time within a part's pages, you are entirely free to structure the content as you wish.
The system supports the easy inclusion of text, images, video, source-code, and anything else you
want the learner to be able to access.

The basic workflow for creating teaching materials is as follows:

#. :doc:`Create a new module <module/new>`
#. :doc:`Add parts to the new module <part/index>`
#. :doc:`Add pages to the new part <page/index>`
#. :doc:`Change the status of the module and part to make them available <status>`
