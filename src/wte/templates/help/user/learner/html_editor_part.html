<h1>HTML Editor Sections<a class="headerlink" href="#html-editor-sections" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>HTML Editor Sections combine the tutorial text, an HTML/CSS/JavaScript editor, and
an HTML viewer into a single interface. These are laid out like this:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="48%" />
<col width="52%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td rowspan="2">Tutorial</td>
<td>Workspace</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Viewer</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<div class="section" id="tutorial">
<h2>Tutorial<a class="headerlink" href="#tutorial" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>On the left the <em>tutorial</em> contains the actual text of the tutorial that you
are following. At the top and bottom of the <em>tutorial</em> you will find the
<span class="text-link">Previous page</span> and <span class="text-link">Next page</span> links that allow you to
move forwards and back through the tutorial&#8217;s content. Additionally you can
use the drop-down list to quickly jump between pages.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="workspace">
<h2>Workspace<a class="headerlink" href="#workspace" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Each tutorial will consist of one or more files that you will work on as you
follow the tutorial. These files will be shown in the <em>workspace</em> area as a series
of tabs. You can switch between the files by clicking on the tab with the
filename of the file you wish to edit.</p>
<p>Whenever you make a change to one of the files, the change is automatically
saved after a few seconds of inactivity. If you do not want to wait that long,
you can click on the <span class="fi-save"></span> icon. To indicate that there are unsaved
changes the tab will turn red when you make a change and green after the change
has been saved.</p>
<p>All the work you do is saved on the server. This means that if you leave the
tutorial and come back to it at a later point, the content of the files will
be exactly as you left them.</p>
<div class="section" id="downloading-files">
<h3>Downloading files<a class="headerlink" href="#downloading-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you want to download the files&#8217; content for working on them offline, you
can do that by clicking on the <span class="fi-list"></span> icon in the top-right corner.
Then select the <span class="dropdown-link">Download the Workspace</span> item. This will generate
a ZIP file, which contains all the files in the <em>workspace</em>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you want to download a single file, click on the <span class="fi-list"></span> icon
on the tab of the file that you want to download. Then, from the drop-down menu
select the <span class="dropdown-link">Download</span> option to download that one file.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="discarding-changes">
<h3>Discarding changes<a class="headerlink" href="#discarding-changes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes you might want to discard some or all of the changes that you have
made to one or more files and re-start with the initial file contents. To
discard all changes, click on the <span class="fi-list"></span> icon in the top-right corner and from
the drop-down menu select <span class="dropdown-link">Discard all Changes</span>. This action cannot be undone,
so you will be asked to confirm that you want to discard all changes. If you
confirm that you want to discard all changes, the page will re-load and the
files will have been reset to their initial state.</p>
<p>If you want to discard the changes from a single file, click on the <span class="fi-list"></span> icon
in the tab of the file that you want to reset. Then select the
<span class="dropdown-link">Discard Changes</span> option from the drop-down menu. The action cannot be undone, so you
will be asked to confirm that you want to discard the changes to that file. If
you confirm that you want to discard the changes, then the page will re-load
and the file will have been reset to its initial state. All other files will
retain the modifications you have made.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="viewer">
<h2>Viewer<a class="headerlink" href="#viewer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>On the right-hand side in the bottom half is the page <em>viewer</em>, which shows the
HTML page&#8217;s content. You can interact with this as you would with any other
HTML page and it allows you to try out what your HTML code would look like in
practice. The content of the <em>viewer</em> will automatically re-load whenever you
make a change to any of the files in the <em>workspace</em>.</p>
<div class="section" id="view-in-new-tab-window">
<h3>View in new tab / window<a class="headerlink" href="#view-in-new-tab-window" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>While the <em>viewer</em> works like a normal web-page, it is somewhat restricted in
its size. If you want to see what your HTML would look like in its own tab or
window, then click on the <span class="fi-list"></span> icon in the top-right corner of the <em>viewer</em>.
From the drop-down menu, select the <span class="dropdown-link">Open in new Tab/Window</span> option and the
page will be opened in a new tab or window (which one depends on your browser&#8217;s
settings).</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The content of the new tab or window will <strong>not</strong> be updated
automatically if you make any changes in the <em>workspace</em>. If you make
changes in the <em>workspace</em> then you need to manually re-load the page in
the new tab or window for those changes to become visible.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="quizzes">
<h2>Quizzes<a class="headerlink" href="#quizzes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Web Teaching Environment allows the tutor to set small quizzes. To answer the quiz,
simply select the correct answers and then click on the <span class="button">Check Answers</span> button.
You will immediately be shown which answers you got right and which are wrong. You can re-try
any questions that you did not get right.</p>
