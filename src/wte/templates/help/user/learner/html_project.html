<h1>HTML Project<a class="headerlink" href="#html-project" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The HTML task interface is similar to the <a class="reference internal" href="html_tutorial.html"><em>HTML Tutorial</em></a> interface,
but it only consists of the following two parts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the file <em>workspace</em>;</li>
<li>and the page <em>viewer</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are laid out like this:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Workspace</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Viewer</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<div class="section" id="workspace">
<h2>Workspace<a class="headerlink" href="#workspace" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The workspace lists the files and assets that you have created for your project
as a series of tabs. You can switch between the files by clicking on the tab
with the filename of the file you wish to edit.</p>
<p>Whenever you make a change to one of the files, the change is automatically
saved to the Web Teaching Environment. If you leave the task and come back
to it at a later point, the content of the files will be exactly as you left
it.</p>
<div class="section" id="creating-a-new-file">
<h3>Creating a new file<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-new-file" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To create a new file, click on the pencil icon in the top-right corner of the
page. This will show a drop-down menu and from the menu select the &#8220;Add File&#8221;
option.</p>
<p>You then need to give your new file a filename and then click on the
<span class="button">Create</span> button.</p>
<p>Optionally, if you have a pre-existing file that you want to work on in your
project, then you can use the &#8220;Browse&#8221; button to upload the existing file into
your project.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">If you upload an existing file, it will be uploaded under the
filename you specify, not the filename it has on your local system.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-a-new-asset">
<h3>Creating a new asset<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-new-asset" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To create a new asset, click on the pencil icon in the top-right corner of the
page. This will show a drop-down menu and from the menu select the &#8220;Add Asset&#8221;
option. The difference between a &#8220;file&#8221; and an &#8220;asset&#8221; is that you can edit
the contents of a &#8220;file&#8221;, while the contents of an &#8220;asset&#8221; is static. In most
cases your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be &#8220;files&#8221;, while any images or other
media will be &#8220;assets&#8221;.</p>
<p>You need to give your new asset a filename. For an asset you must upload an
existing file. Use the &#8220;Browse&#8221; button to select an existing file to upload as
the new asset. Finally click on the <span class="button">Create</span> button to create your
new asset.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>

filename it has on your local system.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="downloading-files">
<h3>Downloading files<a class="headerlink" href="#downloading-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you want to download the files&#8217; content for working on them offline, you
can do that by clicking on the menu icon in the top-right corner. This will
show you a drop-down menu, from which you select the &#8220;Download the Workspace&#8221;
option. This will generate a ZIP file, which contains all the files in the
<em>workspace</em>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you want to download a single file, click on the menu icon
on the tab of the file that you want to download. Then, from the drop-down menu
select the &#8220;Download&#8221; option to download that one file.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="deleting-the-project">
<h3>Deleting the project<a class="headerlink" href="#deleting-the-project" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To delete your project, click on the menu icon in the top-right corner and
select the &#8220;Delete&#8221; option from the drop-down menu. This action cannot be
undone, so you will be asked to confirm that you want to delete your project.
If you confirm, your project and all its files and assets will be deleted
and you will be taken back to the list of your <a class="reference internal" href="projects.html"><em>projects</em></a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="viewer">
<h2>Viewer<a class="headerlink" href="#viewer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>On the right-hand side in the bottom half is the page <em>viewer</em>, which shows the
HTML page&#8217;s content. You can interact with this as you would with any other
HTML page and it allows you to try out what your HTML code would look like in
practice. The content of the <em>viewer</em> will automatically re-load whenever you
make a change to any of the files in the <em>workspace</em>.</p>
<div class="section" id="view-in-new-tab-window">
<h3>View in new tab / window<a class="headerlink" href="#view-in-new-tab-window" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>While the <em>viewer</em> works like a normal web-page, it is somewhat restricted in
its size. If you want to see what your HTML would look like in its own tab or
window, then click on the menu icon in the top-right corner of the <em>viewer</em>.
From the drop-down menu, select the &#8220;Open in new Tab/Window&#8221; option and the
page will be opened in a new tab or window (which one depends on your browser&#8217;s
settings).</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The content of the new tab or window will <strong>not</strong> be updated
automatically if you make any changes in the <em>workspace</em>. If you make
changes in the <em>workspace</em> then you need to manually re-load the page in
the new tab or window for those changes to become visible.</p>
