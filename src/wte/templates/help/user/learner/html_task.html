<h1>HTML Tasks<a class="headerlink" href="#html-tasks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The HTML task interface is the same as the <a class="reference internal" href="html_tutorial.html"><em>HTML Tutorial</em></a> interface
and consists of three parts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the <em>task</em> instructions;</li>
<li>the file <em>workspace</em>;</li>
<li>and the page <em>viewer</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are laid out like this:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="56%" />
<col width="44%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td rowspan="2">Instructions</td>
<td>Workspace</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Viewer</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<div class="section" id="instructions">
<h2>Instructions<a class="headerlink" href="#instructions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>On the left the <em>instructions</em> contain the text instructions for the task.
Unlike in the HTML tutorials, you cannot directly switch between tasks in
an exercise. To move to another task, click on the <span class="topbar-link">Name of
the Exercise</span> at the top of the page and then select the task you want to
move to.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="workspace">
<h2>Workspace<a class="headerlink" href="#workspace" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Each task will consist of one or more files that you will work on as you
complete the task. These files will be shown in the <em>workspace</em> area as a
series of tabs. You can switch between the files by clicking on the tab with
the filename of the file you wish to edit.</p>
<p>Whenever you make a change to one of the files, the change is automatically
saved to the Web Teaching Environment. If you leave the task and come back
to it at a later point, the content of the files will be exactly as you left
it.</p>
<div class="section" id="downloading-files">
<h3>Downloading files<a class="headerlink" href="#downloading-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you want to download the files&#8217; content for working on them offline, you
can do that by clicking on the menu icon in the top-right corner. This will
show you a drop-down menu, from which you select the &#8220;Download the Workspace&#8221;
option. This will generate a ZIP file, which contains all the files in the
<em>workspace</em>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you want to download a single file, click on the menu icon
on the tab of the file that you want to download. Then, from the drop-down menu
select the &#8220;Download&#8221; option to download that one file.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="discarding-changes">
<h3>Discarding changes<a class="headerlink" href="#discarding-changes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes you might want to discard some or all of the changes that you have
made to one or more files and re-start with the initial file contents. To
discard all changes, click on the menu icon in the top-right corner and from
the drop-down menu select &#8220;Discard all Changes&#8221;. This action cannot be undone,
so you will be asked to confirm that you want to discard all changes. If you
confirm that you want to discard all changes, the page will re-load and the
files will have been reset to their initial state.</p>
<p>If you want to discard the changes from a single file, click on the menu icon
in the tab of the file that you want to reset. Then select the &#8220;Discard
Changes&#8221; option from the drop-down menu. The action cannot be undone, so you
will be asked to confirm that you want to discard the changes to that file. If
you confirm that you want to discard the changes, then the page will re-load
and the file will have been reset to its initial state. All other files will
retain the modifications you have made.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="viewer">
<h2>Viewer<a class="headerlink" href="#viewer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>On the right-hand side in the bottom half is the page <em>viewer</em>, which shows the
HTML page&#8217;s content. You can interact with this as you would with any other
HTML page and it allows you to try out what your HTML code would look like in
practice. The content of the <em>viewer</em> will automatically re-load whenever you
make a change to any of the files in the <em>workspace</em>.</p>
<div class="section" id="view-in-new-tab-window">
<h3>View in new tab / window<a class="headerlink" href="#view-in-new-tab-window" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>While the <em>viewer</em> works like a normal web-page, it is somewhat restricted in
its size. If you want to see what your HTML would look like in its own tab or
window, then click on the menu icon in the top-right corner of the <em>viewer</em>.
From the drop-down menu, select the &#8220;Open in new Tab/Window&#8221; option and the
page will be opened in a new tab or window (which one depends on your browser&#8217;s
settings).</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The content of the new tab or window will <strong>not</strong> be updated
automatically if you make any changes in the <em>workspace</em>. If you make
changes in the <em>workspace</em> then you need to manually re-load the page in
the new tab or window for those changes to become visible.</p>
